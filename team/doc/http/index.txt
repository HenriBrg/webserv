--------> HTTP/2

HTTP/2 is the successor to the HTTP/1.1 standard which, among other benefits,
reduces page load times and bandwidth used. While the HTTP/2 specification applies to both HTTP and HTTP traffic,
web browsers currently do not support unencrypted HTTP/2, so it can only be used with TLS.

HSTS is used to force browsers to only connect using HTTPS
